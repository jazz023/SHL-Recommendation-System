PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Hiring managers often struggle to find the right assessments for the roles that they are hiring for. The current
system relies on keyword searches and filters, making the process time-consuming and inefficient. Your task
is to build an intelligent recommendation system that simplifies this process. Given a natural language
query or a job description text or URL, your application should return a list of relevant SHL assessments.
